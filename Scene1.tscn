Running back from the woods, little Ballsworth finds her home destroyed and her family fused with a marble. 
Her mother, barely alive asks little Ballsworth to escape through the back of the village. 
However, the little Ballsworth wants to escape with all of them and tries to lift the marble. 
As she tries to lift the marble, she absorbs the power of the marble which awakens a beastly instinct inside her.
With this new power of hers, Ballsworth vows to fight for revenge."
